# PwshDocker
PwshDocker is a PowerShell wrapper around the Docker API

# Why PwshDocker?
I have found that folks new to Docker want the ability to use something they're comfortable with. For folks that are comfortable with PowerShell and the way that PowerShell works, this should improve the experience.

## Dependencies
    - PowerShell Core (newest version preferably)
    - Docker installed
